# Dalbir's Public TODO List

Welcome to my TODO list. You can see I have a lot to do, so why not pick
something off the list and do it for me! :-)

## Finsih S1

No words to explain ~

## Password Synchronization

I have lots of passwords.

I try to always generate a new password for every website I reluctantly create
an account on. Usually in the 32-64 character range. Remembering them all is
simply impossible for my feeble mind.

But thankfully Chrome can use Seahorse for key storage. (I'm not sure if
epiphany is doing this yet, I didn't see any saved website passwords in there).

Additionally, I update my GPG keyring occasionally and it's always a pain when
I have to refetch a key because my normal keyring is on another machine.

I even have a few SSH keys that are used with various third-party systems.

This means that every time I switch machines I there is some minor security
inconvenience that could weaken my security. For example, ever send an email
without encryption simply because you didn't have your GPG keyring handy?
